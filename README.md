# Course NFT Marketplace

## Description

The Course NFT Marketplace is a decentralized smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that enables the tokenization and trading of educational course access. This innovative platform allows instructors to create and monetize their courses as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), while students can purchase permanent access to these courses using AptosCoin.

The smart contract provides a secure and transparent mechanism for course creators to list their educational content and for learners to acquire verified ownership of course access rights. Each course is represented as a unique NFT with specific metadata including course ID, pricing, and instructor information, ensuring authenticity and preventing unauthorized access.

Key features include:
- **Course Tokenization**: Instructors can mint their courses as NFTs with custom pricing
- **Secure Transactions**: All payments are handled through AptosCoin with automatic transfers
- **Access Management**: Students receive verifiable proof of course ownership
- **Decentralized Ownership**: No central authority controls course access or payments

## Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize the online education industry by creating a decentralized, trustless marketplace where knowledge becomes a tradeable digital asset. We aim to:

- **Democratize Education**: Enable anyone to become a course creator and monetize their expertise globally
- **Ensure True Ownership**: Provide students with permanent, transferable access to their purchased courses
- **Eliminate Intermediaries**: Remove traditional platform fees and restrictions through blockchain technology
- **Create Value for Knowledge**: Establish a new economy where educational content can appreciate in value
- **Build Trust**: Leverage blockchain transparency to create verifiable credentials and authentic learning experiences

By tokenizing education, we envision a future where learning becomes an investment, courses can be resold, and educational achievements are permanently recorded on-chain.
